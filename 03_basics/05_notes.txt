JavaScript is a single threaded language
JavaScript Execution Context
->GCE-Global Execution Context (this)
->function/functional Execution Context
->Eval Execution Context

JavaScript code execute in two phases
1. Memory creation phase(Memory allocation)
2. Execution phase

steps in code Execution
(MEMORY PHASE)
1. Global Execution (this)
2. Memory Phase (val1->undefined)
3. function->definition
4. result->variable

(EXECUTION PHASE)
1. val1<-10
2. function-> new variable environment + Execution thread (New Execution Context)

now there will be two phase for the function (creation and Execution phase)

(Memory phase)
val1->undefined
total->undefined

(Execution phase)
num1->10
total->10 (return to parent Execution context)
the new execution context will be deleted after returning value

|Global Execution|

summary
a new Execution context will be created each time a function gets called
